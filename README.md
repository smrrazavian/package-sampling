# Package Sampling

A Python implementation of various probability-based sampling algorithms, inspired by the R package [sampling](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/sampling/index.html). This package offers a variety of sampling methods like `Till√©'s Method`, `Poisson Sampling`, `Systematic Sampling`, and more, designed for **unequal probability** sampling. The algorithms are implemented in a way that supports both theoretical understanding and real-world use cases.

## Installation

You can install the package directly from PyPI:

```bash
pip install package-sampling
```

## Usage Example

```python
from package_sampling.sampling import up_brewer
import numpy as np

probabilities = np.array([0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4])

# Draw a sample using Brewer's method
sample = up_brewer(probabilities)
print(sample)
```
